\`\`\`

## Usage

### Basic Usage
\`\`\`python
from Agentic_AI.integrated_analyzer import IntegratedMarketAnalyzer

# Initialize analyzer
analyzer = IntegratedMarketAnalyzer()

# Analyze a transcript
result = analyzer.analyze_transcript(transcript_text)

# Generate report
report = analyzer.generate_report(result)
print(report)
\`\`\`

### Historical Analysis
\`\`\`python
# Analyze historical data up to a specific date
historical_result = analyzer.analyze_with_history("2024/04/14")
\`\`\`

## Data Structure

### 1. Transcript Processing (transcript_node.py)
- Processes raw transcripts from financial videos
- Performs intelligent text segmentation and summarization
- Extracts key market insights and sentiment indicators
- Utilizes LangChain and Ollama for natural language processing

### 2. Market Analysis (market_node.py)
- Implements ReAct (Reasoning + Action) architecture for market analysis
- Processes market data through a multi-stage pipeline:
  - Analysis ‚Üí Thinking ‚Üí Decision
- Integrates with external data sources (yfinance, technical indicators)
- Provides dynamic market sentiment assessment

### 3. Decision Making (decision_node.py)
- Implements ReAct (Reasoning + Action) architecture for decision making
- Features advanced reflection and self-improvement capabilities:
  - Analyze ‚Üí Think ‚Üí Decide workflow
  - Multi-stage thinking process with data gathering
  - Detailed reasoning and observation tracking
- Provides two decision generation modes:
  - Standard mode: Direct analysis and decision
  - Reflection mode: Deep thinking with multiple analysis cycles
- Implements comprehensive risk management
- Produces detailed investment reports with:
  - Technical analysis
  - Fundamental metrics
  - Risk assessments
  - Position sizing recommendations
  - Full reasoning trace

### 4. Integrated Analysis (integrated_analyzer.py)
- Combines all components into a unified analysis pipeline
- Provides historical data analysis capabilities
- Generates comprehensive market reports
- Implements sentiment tracking and trend analysis

## Key Features

- ü§ñ AI-Powered Analysis: Utilizes advanced LLM models for market analysis
- üìà Technical Analysis: Integrates multiple technical indicators
- üìä Fundamental Analysis: Processes company fundamentals and macro indicators
- üéØ Risk Management: Built-in risk assessment and position sizing
- üìù Detailed Reporting: Generates comprehensive investment reports
- üîÑ Historical Analysis: Supports historical data processing and backtesting

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Required packages (install via pip):
  - langchain
  - langchain-ollama
  - opencc
  - pandas
  - yfinance
  - ta-lib
  - numpy

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Agents4Financial.git
cd Agents4Financial
\`\`\`

2. Install dependencies:
\`\`\`bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`

3. Configure the Ollama model in constant.py:
\`\`\`python
model_name = "gemma3:27b"  # or your preferred model
\`\`\`

## Usage

### Basic Usage
\`\`\`python
from Agentic_AI.integrated_analyzer import IntegratedMarketAnalyzer
from Agentic_AI.decision_node import DecisionAgent

# Initialize analyzer and decision agent
analyzer = IntegratedMarketAnalyzer()
decision_agent = DecisionAgent()

# Standard decision making
decision = decision_agent.generate_decision(stock_analysis, market_context)

# Advanced decision making with reflection
reflective_decision = decision_agent.generate_decision_with_reflection(stock_analysis, market_context)

# Generate detailed report
report = decision_agent.generate_report(reflective_decision)
print(report)
\`\`\`

### Historical Analysis
\`\`\`python
# Analyze historical data up to a specific date
historical_result = analyzer.analyze_with_history("2024/04/14")
\`\`\`

## Data Structure

The system uses a modular architecture with several key components:

- **TranscriptAgent**: Processes and summarizes financial transcripts
- **ReActMarketAgent**: Analyzes market conditions using ReAct architecture
- **DecisionAgent**: Generates investment decisions with risk management
- **IntegratedMarketAnalyzer**: Combines all components for comprehensive analysis

## Output Format

## Multi-Agent Collaboration & Reflection Mechanisms

### Multi-Agent System Overview

- **TranscriptAgent**: Handles transcript preprocessing, segmentation, summarization, and keyword extraction to ensure high-quality input for downstream analysis.
- **ReActMarketAgent**: Implements a ReAct (Reasoning + Action) workflow for market sentiment analysis and multi-step reasoning. Dynamically queries real-time data (e.g., price, technical indicators) as needed, and records each reasoning/action step as a `ThoughtProcess`. Supports multi-turn think-act cycles for robust decision-making.
- **DecisionAgent**: Performs multi-dimensional stock analysis (technical, fundamental, risk) and generates investment decisions. Supports both standard and reflection (multi-turn, self-correcting) modes. In reflection mode, the agent iteratively refines its reasoning, automatically falls back on defaults when errors occur, and logs all errors and reasoning steps.
- **IntegratedMarketAnalyzer**: Orchestrates all agents, integrates transcript, market, and stock analyses, applies historical weighting, computes confidence scores, and produces comprehensive, structured reports and recommendations.

### Reflection & Self-Correction Features

- **Multi-Turn Reasoning & Reflection**: Both DecisionAgent and ReActMarketAgent support iterative "think ‚Üí action ‚Üí observation" cycles. When information is insufficient or errors are detected, the agent automatically adjusts its reasoning direction and logs each step in `ThoughtProcess`.
- **Error Handling & Fallbacks**: On data parsing/API/model errors, agents fall back to safe defaults (e.g., neutral sentiment) and record error messages in the reasoning trace for future reference.
- **Reasoning Trace & Decision Audit**: All reasoning, queries, and decisions are logged for later analysis, enabling identification of failure patterns and continuous improvement.
- **Historical Result Analysis**: Analysis results and decisions are persistently saved (e.g., `analysis_results.json`), supporting offline mining of failure cases and optimization of agent strategies.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Agents4Financial.git
cd Agents4Financial
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure the Ollama model in constant.py:
```python
model_name = "gemma3:27b"  # or your preferred model
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```python
from Agentic_AI.integrated_analyzer import IntegratedMarketAnalyzer
from Agentic_AI.decision_node import DecisionAgent

# Initialize analyzer and decision agent
analyzer = IntegratedMarketAnalyzer()
decision_agent = DecisionAgent()

# Standard decision making
decision = decision_agent.generate_decision(stock_analysis, market_context)

# Advanced decision making with reflection
reflective_decision = decision_agent.generate_decision_with_reflection(stock_analysis, market_context)

# Generate detailed report
report = decision_agent.generate_report(reflective_decision)
print(report)
```

### Historical Analysis
```python
# Analyze historical data up to a specific date
historical_result = analyzer.analyze_with_history("2024/04/14")
```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Required packages (install via pip):
  - langchain
  - langchain-ollama
  - opencc
  - pandas
  - yfinance
  - ta-lib
  - numpy
  - IPython

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Agents4Financial.git
cd Agents4Financial
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure the Ollama model in constant.py:
```python
model_name = "gemma3:27b"  # or your preferred model
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```python
from Agentic_AI.integrated_analyzer import IntegratedMarketAnalyzer
from Agentic_AI.decision_node import DecisionAgent

# Initialize analyzer and decision agent
analyzer = IntegratedMarketAnalyzer()
decision_agent = DecisionAgent()

# Standard decision making
decision = decision_agent.generate_decision(stock_analysis, market_context)

# Advanced decision making with reflection
reflective_decision = decision_agent.generate_decision_with_reflection(stock_analysis, market_context)

# Generate detailed report
report = decision_agent.generate_report(reflective_decision)
print(report)
```

### Historical Analysis
```python
# Analyze historical data up to a specific date
historical_result = analyzer.analyze_with_history("2024/04/14")
```

## Data Structure

The system uses a modular architecture with several key components:

- **TranscriptProcessor**: Low-level text processing and summarization
- **TranscriptAgent**: High-level transcript analysis workflow
- **ReActMarketAgent**: Market analysis with reasoning capabilities
